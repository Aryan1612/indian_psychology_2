### A Course Project for Introduction to Indian Psychology (Autumn 2025)

## 💡 Project Overview

This project is an interactive web-based infographic that serves as a **preliminary study and report** for our course.

It provides a visual model for understanding the **Pancha Kosha (The Five Sheaths)**, a core concept from the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, foundational to Indian psychology. The infographic visually contrasts the states of a person whose sheaths are in alignment versus one whose sheaths are misaligned.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

The project is centered on the five-layered model of human consciousness:

1.  **Annamaya Kosha** (Physical Body Sheath)
2.  **Prāṇamaya Kosha** (Vital Energy Sheath)
3.  **Manomaya Kosha** (Mind Sheath)
4.  **Vijñānamaya Kosha** (Knowledge/Wisdom Sheath)
5.  **Ānandamaya Kosha** (Bliss Sheath)

The central thesis, as shown in the infographic, is that psychological and spiritual well-being is achieved when the lower sheaths (Body, Energy, Mind) are guided by and aligned with the higher sheaths (Knowledge, Bliss).

## 🖥️ Infographic Structure

The webpage uses a three-column layout to compare different states of alignment, each visualized with an animated canvas:

1.  **A — Harmonious:** All five sheaths are aligned, resulting in peace, clarity, and vitality. The animation shows all five "waves" moving in perfect synchrony.
2.  **B — Partially Harmonious:** The higher sheaths are somewhat aligned, but the lower sheaths (Mind, Energy) fluctuate, leading to inconsistency. The animation shows some waves in sync and others out of phase.
3.  **C — Misaligned:** The lower sheaths act independently, disconnected from higher awareness. This results in chronic stress and confusion, visualized as chaotic and clashing waves.
